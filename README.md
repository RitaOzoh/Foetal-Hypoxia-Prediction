Overview:
This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project conducted in RStudio to predict foetal hypoxia using the Cardiotocography (CTG) dataset. Foetal hypoxia is a critical condition that can have severe implications during pregnancy and childbirth. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to create a predictive model that assists in early detection and intervention.

Features:
Utilized Random Forest and K-Nearest-Neighbour algorithms to build predictive models.
Conducted data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploration to enhance model performance.
Evaluated model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's predictive capabilities.

Dataset:
The CTG dataset used in this project is sourced from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/193/cardiotocography
